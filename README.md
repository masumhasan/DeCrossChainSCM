# Utilising Multichain Blockchain Technology to Enhance Efficiency in Supply Chain Management of Tech Industry

This repository contains the resources, research reports, and presentation slides related to our capstone project aimed at leveraging multichain blockchain technology to improve supply chain efficiency in the tech industry.

## Project Overview

The complexity of supply chain management in the tech industry calls for advanced solutions to address inefficiencies, data silos, and transparency issues. Our project proposes a decentralized multichain blockchain framework to enhance scalability, transparency, and trust among stakeholders. Key features include:

- **Core Blockchain**: A secure core for critical transactions and data.
- **Sidechains**: Specialized sidechains tailored for distinct supply chain functions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automation of processes to minimize errors and increase efficiency.
- **Hybrid On-Chain/Off-Chain Data Management**: Ensuring privacy and scalability using Merkle tree proofs.
